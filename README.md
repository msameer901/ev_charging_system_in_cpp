# Electric Vehicle Charging System â€“ C++ Project

This project simulates a basic **Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging System** using **C++**, showcasing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and dynamic memory management.

It was developed as a project from CS-107 course on Computer Programming.

## Features

- Simulates EVs arriving at a charging station
- Manages multiple charging slots 
- Calculates charging time based on battery capacity and charging rate
- Uses OOPs principles throughout


## Concepts Used

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes & Objects
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Arrays for dynamic management
- Pointers and References

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ev-charging-system-cpp.git
    cd ev-charging-system-cpp
    ```

2. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    g++ -o ev_charging main.cpp
    ```

3. Run:
    ```bash
    ./ev_charging
    ```

> Ensure you have a C++ compiler like `g++` installed.
